# Flutter Scrcpy-GUI

A gui for [Scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy), made with Flutter.

## Note

- Beginner dev / messy code - this project was made as an effort for me to learn flutter.

- Some features may or may not work as intended on Mac/Windows as this project is developed and tested on Linux with my personal use in mind.


## Features

- Ease of use for setting up and running scrcpy command.
- Save scrcpy config.
- Support for most scrcpy flags + user input flags
- Wireless ADB connect with QR pairing.
- Keep up to date with scrcpy releases.
- List of running scrcpy instances.
- Theming - dark/light + accent color.
- Tray support (start/stop scrcpy).
